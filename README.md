### 1. INTRODUCTION
150+ days since the first COVID-19 case in the World, and 45+ days into the earliest Lockdown Order of India, how is the public feeling in times like these?
The Corona Virus endangers our physical health indeed, but alongside, social distancing also poses a threat to our emotional stability. Thus, it is crucial to understand public sentiments under COVID-19.

#### 1.1. OVERVIEW
Twitter is a place where people express what they truly feel without any social obligations, and hence it is the best place to acquire information about the best interests of people. 
The information is segregated on the based on the “tags” used by people when they were tweeting and sentiment analysis is done on the information extracted. 

#### 1.2. PURPOSE
India is the second most populous country which makes it highly prone to Covid-19.
In such a transient times its crucial to study the public reaction of masses in order to formulate a right minded decision, regarding individual lives and monetary vocations.
No dedicated Indian website exists that works solely for sentiment analysis. 
We wish to market a website that is made for Indians, by Indians.
We deployed Sentiment Analysis on tweets and Topic Modeling on news to aid the understanding of sentiment trends. Based on these, we built dashboards as a daily sentiment monitor product to present the results.
 
### 2. LITERATURE SURVEY
#### 2.1. EXISTING PROBLEM
Microblogging today has become a very popular communication tool among Internet users. Millions of messages are appearing daily in popular web-sites that provide services for microblogging such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook. Authors of those messages write about their life, share opinions on variety of topics and discuss current issues. Because of a free format of messages and an easy accessibility of microblogging platforms, Internet users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as traditional blogs or mailing lists) to microblogging services. As more and more users post about products and services they use, or express their political and religious views, microblogging web-sites become valuable sources of people’s opinions and sentiments. Such data can be efficiently used for marketing or social studies.
	
#### 2.2. PROPOSED SOLUION
To study public sentiments, we chose Twitter as our target field. As one of the world’s biggest social network platforms, Twitter hosts abundant user-generated posts, which closely reflect the public’s reactions towards this pandemic with low latency. By deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods on it, we were able to extract and quantify the public sentiments over time. The tool used for the purpose is IBM Watson Tone Analyzer .
Then we dove in to analyze the sentiments on a more detailed level, in a multi-dimensional way, to reveal the trend more comprehensively. We used the IBM Watson Tone analyzer along with manual tags to label the sampled tweets with five sentiments and then built a classification model 
With this, we were able to: 
1) identify subtler sentiments in a tweet
2) define a metric Sentiment Density, which could represent the complexity of the tweets’ sentiment.

### 5. CONCLUSION 
* The preliminary investigations derived from the data suggests that 68% were taking precautions necessary for not contacting the Covid-19. 21% didn’t believe that coronavirus can impact Indians at large 4% didn’t know about coronavirus. And 3% had no opinion. 
* The sentiments changed as the Government response, for the measurements of Covid-19 changed over time. 

* Economic ideas were impacted with corona as shown :

|               | Mar(27-30)    | Apr(3-13)   | May(1-25)   | Jun(8-22)   |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| Optimistic    | 52%           | 57%         | 49%         | 51%         |
| Mixed         | 36%           | 30%         | 39%         | 38%         |
| Pessimistic   | 12%           | 13%         | 12%         | 11%         | 

(Mar 27/2020 considered as day1 since Lockdown was declared then)

* The results of the study concludes that while majority of the people in India are taking a assertive and analytical approach, there are also instances of fear, sadness and anger towards the officials exhibited. 

* Direct engagement with organizations working to contain the threat
Experts, NGOs, and governments play a pivotal public service role, using Twitter to reach people with the right information when they need it. The platform can be used to amplify authoritative, official content across the globe.

* Dedicated COVID-19 event page
An event page that is constructed solely for data and its usage for Covid-19 purposes can be developed.

* To fight the coronavirus not only needs the guidance from the government but also a positive attitude from the public. Our analysis provides a potential approach to reveal the public’s sentiment status and help institutions respond timely to it.
